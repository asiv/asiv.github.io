    There are three main purposes for visualizations we have found that we have categorized each recommendation into: <br/>
    <b>Communication</b>: To present information in either a presentation or report. Clearly emphasizing information, with less need for explanation.<br/>
    <b>Exploration</b>: To find trends, outliers, or other interesting artifacts in the data. Would often be done by a single person. <br/>
    <b>Discussion</b>: For the purposes of fostering a discussion to achieve deeper goals among a group of end users.<br/>
    Some visualizaitons can work for multiple purposes. <br/>
