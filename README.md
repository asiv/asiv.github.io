Open Website

This is the website for the beta version of the visualization toolkit created for the purposes of requirement feedback. This version provides an easy way to view all the questions that will have visualization recommendations in the final system. 

The toolkit's eventual aim is to help data-workers create visualizations for the data-needs of clients, to help them communicate to and analyze with end users. Mostly built using JSON Editor by @josdejong.
